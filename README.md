# About Jenkins
Jenkins, in simple terms, is an open-source automation tool that helps developers and teams to automate various tasks in the software development process. It allows them to set up and manage continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. These pipelines streamline the process of building, testing, and deploying software, making it faster and more efficient.

In essence, Jenkins is like a helpful assistant that automates repetitive tasks, like compiling code, running tests, and deploying applications, saving time and reducing human error. It is widely used in the software development industry to ensure the quality and timely delivery of software projects.

The following flowchart demonstrates a very simple workflow of how Jenkins works.

# What is Continuous Integration (CI)?

Continuous Integration ( CI ) is a practice where developers regularly integrate their code changes into a shared repository multiple times throughout the day. With each integration, an automated build and a series of automated tests are triggered to verify that the new code integrates correctly with the existing codebase and doesn't introduce any regressions or bugs. The primary goal of CI is to catch integration issues early in the development process, promoting collaboration and ensuring that the codebase remains in a stable state.

<u> Benefits of Continuous Integration: </u>

1.  Early detection of integration issues, reducing the risk of merging conflicts.
   
2.  Faster feedback loop, allowing developers to fix issues quickly.
   
3. Improved code quality and stability.


# What is Continuous Delivery (CD)?

   Continuous Delivery CD is an extension of CI, where the changes that pass the automated tests in the CI phase are automatically and continuously deployed to a staging environment or a production environment. In a continuous delivery pipeline, the software is always in a release-ready state, meaning that any code changes that pass the automated tests can be deployed to users at any time, manually or automatically. This approach reduces the time it takes to deliver new features, bug fixes, and improvements to end-users, leading to more frequent and reliable releases.

<u> Benefits of Continuous Delivery: </u>

 1.   Faster and more predictable software releases.

 2.   Lower risk of human error in the deployment process.

 3.   Enables more frequent updates and responsiveness to user feedback.



CI focuses on automating the process of integrating code changes and running tests, ensuring that the codebase remains stable and free from integration issues. CD extends CI by automating the deployment process, allowing for more frequent and reliable software releases. Together, these practices form a crucial part of modern software development methodologies, promoting collaboration, efficiency, and continuous improvement.
