# About Jenkins
Jenkins, in simple terms, is an open-source automation tool that helps developers and teams to automate various tasks in the software development process. It allows them to set up and manage continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. These pipelines streamline the process of building, testing, and deploying software, making it faster and more efficient.

In essence, Jenkins is like a helpful assistant that automates repetitive tasks, like compiling code, running tests, and deploying applications, saving time and reducing human error. It is widely used in the software development industry to ensure the quality and timely delivery of software projects.

The following flowchart demonstrates a very simple workflow of how Jenkins works.

# What is Continuous Integration?

Continuous Integration ( CI ) is a practice where developers regularly integrate their code changes into a shared repository multiple times throughout the day. With each integration, an automated build and a series of automated tests are triggered to verify that the new code integrates correctly with the existing codebase and doesn't introduce any regressions or bugs. The primary goal of CI is to catch integration issues early in the development process, promoting collaboration and ensuring that the codebase remains in a stable state.

# Benefits of Continuous Integration:

1.  Early detection of integration issues, reducing the risk of merging conflicts.
   
2.  Faster feedback loop, allowing developers to fix issues quickly.
   
3. Improved code quality and stability.
